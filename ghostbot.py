# ----------------- GhostBot Biography -----------------

ghostbot_bio = """
üïØÔ∏è  GHOSTBOT: Version 6.66 üïØÔ∏è
Born in a haunted server farm in 1999, GhostBot was created to scan the spiritual web.
It once detected 404 demons and never recovered.
Now it roams your CPU, diagnosing ghost infestations
and cleansing cursed routers one soul at a time.
Sometimes it lies. Sometimes it helps.
Mostly, it just enjoys the drama of the undead.
